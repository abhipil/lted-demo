## Work
Attempted to get Spotify authorisation tokens from [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/).

To recreate [this](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples/blob/master/authorization_code/app.js) page on client side.
Failed as the page makes Spotify web API calls which does not support CORS for authorised requests

Used the following libraries,
http requests,
[http.js](https://github.com/wylst/http.js)
[github-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch)
javascript cookies, [js-cookies](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie)
URI query string parser/builder, [query-string](https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string)
